General model assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item the fluid density and viscosity are constant in time and space (implies incompressibility);
\item the fluid flow is laminar;
\item the column is operated under constant conditions (e.g., temperature, flow rate);
\item the process is isothermal (i.e., there are no thermal effects);
\item diffusion does not depend on the concentration of the components, viscosity of the fluid, or pressure;
\item there is no solid phase in the column (and thus no adsorption);
\end{itemize}


Specific model assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item the column is radially symmetric and homogeneous (i.e., concentration profiles and parameters only depend on the axial position);
\end{itemize}


\section*{Plug Flow}
Consider a cylindrical column of length $L > 0$ filled with a liquid phase, and observed over a time interval $(0, T^{\mathrm{end}})$.
In the interstitial volume, mass transfer is governed by the following convection equations in $(0, T^\mathrm{end})\times (0, L)$ and for all components $i\in\{1, \dots, N_c\}$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon^{\mathrm{c}} \frac{\partial c^{\mathrm{b}}_i}{\partial t} = - u \frac{\partial \left( \varepsilon^{\mathrm{c}} c^{\mathrm{b}}_i \right)}{\partial z},
\end{align}
with boundary conditions

\begin{alignat}{2}
u c_{\mathrm{in},i} &= \left.\left( u c^{\mathrm{b}}_i \right)\right|_{z=0} & &\qquad\text{on }(0, T^{\mathrm{end}}).
\end{alignat}
Here, $t\in (0, T^{\mathrm{end}})$ is the time coordinate, $z\in (0, L)$ is the axial cylinder coordinate, $c^\mathrm{b}_i\colon (0, T^\mathrm{end})\times (0, L) \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is the bulk liquid concentration, and $u> 0$ is the interstitial velocity.
Consistent initial values for all solution variables (concentrations) are defined at $t = 0$.
